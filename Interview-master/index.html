		<div ID="myDIV"> I don’t want to be a designer; I already am I designer.  I’m a creative person, a lot of what I do everyday expresses that. But I don’t have skills, and I have problems. I need skills to deal with problems. </div>

	<button onclick="Reply2()"><div class="Qs">Why are you here?</div></button>

			<script>
					function Reply2() {
					  var x = document.getElementById("responses2");

		<div ID="responses2">I’m here because I literally do not know what the fuck else to do with myself. I got my degree, decided I didn’t love it enough to spend my life cloistered away in a library. Every career aptitude test I’ve taken says self-employed, but one said designer so lets try that for a bit. </div>


	<button onclick="Reply3()"><div class="Qs">What worries/excites you about being a designer?</div></button> 

			<script>
					function Reply3() {
					  var x = document.getElementById("responses3");
					  if (x.style.display === "none") {
					    x.style.display = "block";
					  } else {
					    x.style.display = "none";
					  }
			}
			</script>

		<div ID="responses3">I never considered myself much of an artist so I was worried my designs would simply be bad. But I've realized design is as much about concepts and problem solving than it is art. That where it differs, that’s where it excites me. What worries me is how fast everything moves, it’s a learning curve to not only learn these technologies but to adapt to the future. I will always be researching & learning about the world.</div>  

	<button onclick="Reply4()"><div class="Qs">What aspect of design do you gravitate towards?</div></button> 

			<script>
					function Reply4() {
					  var x = document.getElementById("responses4");
					  if (x.style.display === "none") {
					    x.style.display = "block";
					  } else {
					    x.style.display = "none";
					  }
			}
			</script>
		<div ID="responses4">Personally, I like character design and costume making. Coming up with a character and making their costumes. I like things that are tangible, functional & beautiful. </div> 

	<button onclick="Reply5()"><div class="Qs">What do you have in your future? </div></button>

			<script>
					function Reply5() {
					  var x = document.getElementById("responses5");
					  if (x.style.display === "none") {
					    x.style.display = "block";
					  } else {
					    x.style.display = "none";
					  }
			}
			</script>

		<div ID="responses5">I don't know guess I’ll die. </div>

	<button onclick="Reply6()"><div class="Qs">What is difficult in design, how do you push past that? </div></button>

			<script>
					function Reply6() {
					  var x = document.getElementById("responses6");
					  if (x.style.display === "none") {
					    x.style.display = "block";
					  } else {
					    x.style.display = "none";
					  }
			}
			</script>

		<div ID="responses6">Communication is a challenge. Everyone’s preference is different and often times were designing things for other people, not ourselves. We need to understand what they’re looking for and learn what they like. We must take those ideas and present them in a clear way, to a specific audience, and they should get it. Art you can say its about whatever bullshit you want its subjective. Design must be a universal language.</div>  

	<button onclick="Reply7()"><div class="Qs">Can design change the world?</div> </button>

			<script>
					function Reply7() {
					  var x = document.getElementById("responses7");
					  if (x.style.display === "none") {
					    x.style.display = "block";
					  } else {
					    x.style.display = "none";
					  }
			}
			</script>

		<div ID="responses7">Big time. Two words. Moveable type. </div> 

	<button onclick="Reply8()"><div class="Qs">What role or responsibility do you think a designer plays in our society?</div> </button>

			<script>
					function Reply8() {
					  var x = document.getElementById("responses8");
					  if (x.style.display === "none") {
					    x.style.display = "block";
					  } else {
					    x.style.display = "none";
					  }
			}
			</script>

		<div ID="responses8">Visual communication is an overarching theme in design. We need to be able to communicate with a diverse audience. With images we only have such little time, it is our responsibility to give the people what they want, to entice people to buy or get behind a cause. Good or bad.  Designers have the power to make everyone’s life a lot easier, or significantly more difficult. Great design can should make the world a safer more accessible place for everyone.</div>
